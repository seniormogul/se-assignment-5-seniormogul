3. User Interface Overview:
   - Explain the main components of the VS Code user interface. Identify and describe the purpose of the Activity Bar, Side Bar, Editor Group, and Status Bar.

 Activity Bar: Provides access to different VS Code functionalities like debugging, extensions, and source control.
 Side Bar: Displays the Explorer (file and folder management),  Search view (search within project), and Source Control view   (version control).
 Editor Group: The central area where you open and edit code files. You can have multiple files open in tabs within each group.
  Status Bar: Displays information about the current file (language, line endings), indentation settings, and running processes.

4. Command Palette:
   - What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.

   Access the Command Palette with Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows). It allows searching for and executing various VS Code actions through a text interface.
Examples:
"New File" to create a new file.
"Format Document" to automatically format the current file.
"Run Python File in Terminal" to execute a Python script.

5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.

Extensions add new features and functionalities to VS Code.
Find extensions in the Extensions view (Code > Extensions). Search for specific features or browse popular categories.
eg css styling 
   eslint

6. Integrated Terminal:
   - Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?

Open the integrated terminal with Ctrl+` (Windows).
Advantages:
Runs within VS Code, avoiding switching between windows.
Integrates with VS Code features like code navigation and debugging.

7. File and Folder Management:
   - Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?

Create new files (File > New File) or folders (right-click in Explorer > New Folder).

Adjust font size under "Editor".

9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

Set breakpoints (lines where execution pauses) by clicking next to line numbers.
Start debugging (F5). VS Code will pause at breakpoints.
Step through code line by line, inspect variables, and modify values.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

Install Git separately (consult Git documentation for installation).
Initialize a Git repository in your project folder (use the integrated terminal and Git commands).
Make changes to your code, then "stage" those changes (mark them for commit).
Commit staged changes with a descriptive message (saves a snapshot of your code).
Connect your local repository to a remote repository on GitHub.
Push your commits to GitHub to share your code and track changes

 Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide screenshots or step-by-step instructions where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by 1st July
